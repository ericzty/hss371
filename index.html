                                    <p>The U.S. Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) was the first public packet-switched computer network. It was first used in 1969 and finally decommissioned in 1989. ARPANET's main use was for academic and research purposes. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET" target="_blank">(wikipedia)</a></p>

                                    <p>Modern web forums have evolved to become more than just a place for discussion; they are now a vibrant social medium that fosters knowledge sharing, collaboration, and community building. When compared to the historical social mediums like ones discussed earlier, modern forums have advanced in terms of usability and interactive capabilities, providing a more engaging experience for users. While BBS acted as electronic bulletin boards for posting public messages, and IRCs allowed real-time text over the internet, they lacked in persistent conversation tracking, and user-friendly interfaces for the web browser. They also combine public group discussions with personal messaging, while also embedding gamification and rich text formatting, which encourages user engagement and community growth. Today, web forums, such as Reddit and Quora, represent not only tools for communication but also mediums for social influence and information exchange on a global scale.</p>

                                    <p>Later on, Facebook (now known as Meta), acquired Instagram, which is a platform focused more on images and is popular among gen Z</p>
                                    <p>Recently, Meta pushed threads, which is Instagram but in a more twitter style, focusing on text</p>

                                    <p>With the rise of video-sharing platforms such as TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts has dramatically transformed the way we consume and engage with online content, marking a significant evolution in social media platforms. TikTok, Reels, and Shorts offer a creative and dynamic way to share and consume information in fast-paced, tightly edited videos. Unlike older social media like Facebook or Twitter that rely heavily on text and static images, these platforms cater to our heightened desire for quick entertainment and instant gratification. There are also great concern for how it impacts our cognitive abilities.

                                    <p>Discord represents a significant shift in online communication and community building, marking a powerful evolution from traditional forums and chat platforms. It is very popular for it's text, voice, and video capabilities. This platform integrates public channels for group discussions and private spaces for personal chats, making it a hybrid of the open collaboration of web forums and the private networking of traditional social platforms. Functionally, it appears as an upgrade from the IRC, but with more user-friendly interfaces, advanced multimedia integration, and specific gaming-friendly features. It is also very popular in school communities with topic focused servers.</p>

                                    <p>Filter bubbles do not run our lives. Personalized filtering by algorithms is not the cause for public opinion formation and has merely trivial effects on search results with major search engines. The concept is mainly used as a metaphor to reduce the complexity of social, economic and technological dynamics on platforms and public debates, but is of little value beyond that.

									<h2 class="major">Findings</h2>
                                    <p> Overall, the available evidence indicates that the Internet can produce both acute and sustained alterations in each of these areas of cognition, which may be reflected in changes in the brain. However, an emerging priority for future research is to determine the effects of extensive online media usage on cognitive development in youth, and examine how this may differ from cognitive outcomes and brain impact of uses of Internet in the elderly.
